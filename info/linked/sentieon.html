    <h1>Sentieon overview</h1>

    <p>Sentieon info here.
        include info on:
        - what it is (genomics toolkit that reimplements/extends open-source best practices in a more optimised C/C++ framework)
        - includes reimplementations of:
            - common aligners e.g. BWA, STAR, Minimap2
            - germline and somatic SNV/indel calling
            - picard/gatk QC and metrics, results are identical to GATK best-practice guidelines
            - CNV pipeline with Broad Institute's CNV calling recommendations incl. panel of normals construction + read depth normalisation. 
        - Results are bit-identical to the originals but much faster -> excellent for high-throughput alignment
        Deployment is simplified using single binary docker image that bundles all modules. Sentieon license managed through `SENTIEON_LICENSE` environment variable in our pipelines, which allows us to use the suite.
