    <h1>Run Workflow</h1>

    <p>
        This task calls the EG and tREX workflows. An <code>if-else</code> loop is used to choose the correct workflow based on the sample types. Specifically, the tasks that can be invoked are called <code>runEgWorkflow</code> and <code>runTrexWorkflow</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        These two tasks use the workflow template JSON and pipeline version tag generated by the <code>compileWorkflow</code> task earlier in the pipeline to download the correct workflow to DNAnexus. Once downloaded, this workflow is run on DNAnexus using the sample or family JSON files that were created by the <code>setupBatch</code> or <code>setupFamilies</code> tasks. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The workflows are run in parallel for each sample/family, and the outputs are stored in the <code>data/</code> subdirectories on DNAnexus.
