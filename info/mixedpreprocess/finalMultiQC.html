    <h1> MultiQC + run metrics report </h1>
<p>
The multiQC report and run metrics are uploaded to DNAnexus. Run metrics are formatted as an excel spreadsheet. The multiQC report is a zip file containing the HTML report and all the underlying data files. The report is generated by the <code>multiQC</code> task, which is run after the <code>runWf</code> task.
