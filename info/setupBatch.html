    <h1>Set up Batch/Set up Families</h1>

    <p>Batches or families are set up based on the type of sequencing data (tREX/exome/genome), and prepared for analysis. Because exomes and genomes are run in trios, we handle these differently to tREX samples, which are run individually.</p>

    <p>The task is run in an <code>if-else</code> loop:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>tREX samples:</strong> Processed individually using <code>setupBatch</code> task.</li>
        <li><strong>Exome and genome samples:</strong> Processed in trios (maternal, paternal, and proband samples) using <code>setupFamilies</code> task. Families are then <strong>scattered</strong> (i.e., each individual sample within the family is processed in parallel).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The task produces a JSON per sample/family, containing each sample's FASTQ files and sample metadata (e.g., sequencing strategy, relationship status). It also sets up sample/family folders, which will be found in the <code>/data/</code> subdirectories on DNAnexus.</p>
